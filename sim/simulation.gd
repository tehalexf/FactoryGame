## The Simulation: the whole authoritative game state, and the project's only
## test seam.
##
## Its entire surface is three things:
##
##     step(actions)    advance exactly one tick
##     hash()           reduce the whole state to one integer
##     query_*(...)     read-only projections
##
## Nothing else gets to touch state. The Godot-side layer turns devices into
## Input Actions, calls `step`, and draws what the queries return — it holds no
## authoritative state of its own, which is what keeps the seam count at one
## (ADR 0001). Later tickets add the modules behind this façade — grid, Belts,
## Machines, Power, Heat, Waves, Turrets, Silo, Delivery — and they are all
## tested through these same three entry points, never directly.
##
## The rules every line behind this façade obeys, from ADR 0002:
##
## * Fixed-point integers only. No floats, in state or in intermediate steps.
## * No wall-clock time. The Simulation has no idea how long a tick took; it only
##   knows which tick it is on. Deciding *when* to step is the caller's business.
##   `TICKS_PER_SECOND` is a conversion rate for tuning values, not a clock.
## * No unseeded randomness. `DeterministicRng`, seeded at construction, is the
##   only source, and its state is part of the hash.
## * No iteration over an unordered collection. Arrays indexed by id, in index
##   order. Where a Dictionary is unavoidable, its keys get sorted first.
##
## `tests/cases/test_simulation_purity.gd` enforces all four against the source of
## every file in this directory, so a later ticket cannot quietly break one.

## Advances the Simulation by exactly one tick, applying the given Input Actions.

## that wants to run at a different speed calls this more or less often, and gets
## bit-identical results either way.
##
## Actions are applied in the order given, before the tick's own updates. Lockstep
## requires every client to see the same order, so the caller is responsible for
## ordering them canonically before they get here.

##
## Three ways an attempt is refused, all of them silent in effect and loud in the
## log, because this arrives while a Run is in progress and a Run in progress must
## not be taken down by a typo:
##
##   * no payload — nothing to apply;
##   * the payload failed to load — applying it would leave the Run with no content;
##   * the payload does not hash to the digest the action claims — in lockstep that
##     means the action and the set disagree, and applying it would desync.
##
## A refusal leaves the definitions and the generation counter exactly as they were,
## so a refused reload is not a reload and the hash does not move.
